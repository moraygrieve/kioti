    <title>ReceiveFlow - check latency of single initiateFlow and receive, using repeated RPC calls</title>
    <purpose><![CDATA[
In this test we perform a single initiateFlow and receive call, however we drive it multiple
times via RPC. The aim is to see if the initiateFlow and receive calls are optimised after
the first instantiation, even when driven from separate RPC invokations.
